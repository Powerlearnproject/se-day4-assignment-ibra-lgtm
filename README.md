Software engineering is the disciplined application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software systems. It aims to produce high-quality software that meets user requirements and is reliable, scalable, and maintainable. By leveraging systematic methods and best practices, software engineering involves project management, design methodologies, and rigorous testing to ensure that software projects are completed on time, within budget, and to specified standards.
